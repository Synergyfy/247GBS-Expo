      <p>We are thrilled to announce the rollout of AI-Powered Booth Analytics 2.0, a significant leap forward in how exhibitors understand their audience. This update introduces real-time sentiment analysis and deeper engagement metrics, allowing businesses to pivot their strategies on the fly during live events.</p>
      
      <h3>Real-Time Sentiment Tracking</h3>
      <p>Using our new neural engine, exhibitors can now see a live heat map of visitor sentiment. Are people excited? Curious? Or do they need more information? This data is anonymized to protect privacy while providing invaluable insights into customer behavior.</p>

      <h3>Engagement Depth Metrics</h3>
      <p>Go beyond simple click-through rates. Analytics 2.0 measures how long a visitor hovers over specific product features, which parts of your demo videos are watched most, and which downloadable resources are triggering the most interest.</p>

      <h3>Empowering Data-Driven Decisions</h3>
      <p>With this update, 247GBS continues its mission to provide the most robust digital exhibition tools in the world. Our goal is to ensure every exhibitor has the data they need to maximize their ROI and build lasting relationships with their visitors.</p>
