# Virtual Seasonal Exhibition — Full Setup &amp; Step\-by\-Step Guide \(MCOM Mall\)

## 1\) Quick overview \(what this is\)

- The Virtual Seasonal Exhibition is an online event inside MCOM Mall — think of a digital fair where businesses set up booths, show products or services, run live demos, and sell to visitors\.
- We run four exhibitions across the year \(seasonal\)\. Dates are published on the exhibition page so visitors can plan\.
- We can host the expo on a subdomain \(example: `exhibition\.mcommall\.com`\) so it looks and feels like a separate event while still using the main MCOM Mall accounts and listings\.
- Pricing \(example already on your pricing page\): 

## 2\) What we will need \(list of systems &#x2F; features\)

1. **Event landing page &#x2F; subdomain** — a single page with dates, schedule, exhibitor list, and large CTA to &quot;Visit the Exhibition\.&quot; \(e\.g\. `exhibition\.mcommall\.com`\)
2. **Exhibitor portal \(backend\)** — where businesses sign up, pay, upload booth content, and manage orders\.
3. **Booth builder &#x2F; booth templates** — easy form or wizard where exhibitors add logo, banner, product list, videos, live session times, and contact details\.
4. **Product &amp; service listings sync** — ability to import existing MCOM Mall listings or add new ones\.
5. **Payment gateway &amp; split payouts** — collect payments from buyers and send payouts to sellers \(or hold in escrow if required\)\.
6. **Live streaming &#x2F; webinar integration** — for product demos, panels, Q&amp;A \(Zoom, YouTube Live, Agora, or an embed player\)\.
7. **Chat &amp; lead capture** — live chat per booth and a way to capture email&#x2F;phone leads for exhibitors\.
8. **Booking system** — for appointment\-based services \(service providers can publish slots and accept bookings\)\.
9. **Order management** — view, process, ship, or deliver digital goods; handle refunds and returns\.
10. **Support &amp; moderation tools** — admin tools for approving booths, removing bad content, answering exhibitor questions\.
11. **Marketing toolkit** — emails, banners, social post templates, promo codes for exhibitors to promote their booth\.
12. **Analytics dashboard** — per\-booth and event\-wide analytics \(views, clicks, chats, sales, conversions\)\.
13. **Email &amp; SMS system** — confirmations, reminders for live sessions, abandoned cart reminders\.
14. **Media hosting &#x2F; CDN** — store images and videos so pages load fast\.
15. **Security &amp; compliance** — SSL, KYC for sellers \(if needed\), rules for prohibited items, tax rules\.
16. **Admin dashboard** — create the event, manage pricing packages, approve sellers, issue refunds, export reports\.

## 5\) Handling Existing Businesses &amp; Consumers vs New Ones

**Existing Businesses \(already in MCOM Mall\)**

- **Best approach:** Invite them to opt\-in\. Let them copy or sync their current listing into a booth with a single click\.
- **What to offer:** Pre\-filled booth template \(pull logo, product catalog, descriptions\), one\-click apply to event, discount code for early sign\-up if you want to encourage participation\.
- **Process:** Email campaign → exhibitor clicks &quot;Join Exhibition&quot; → chooses package → review pre\-filled booth → publish\.

**New Businesses \(not yet on MCOM Mall\)**

- **Best approach:** Guided sign\-up wizard and booth template\.
- **What to provide:** A simple checklist and a &quot;starter kit&quot; containing: image templates, social post templates, a 10\-minute onboarding video, and a short list of recommended copy\.
- **Process:** Sign up → verify identity&#x2F;business → choose package → fill guided booth form → submit for approval\.

**Existing Consumers \(already have MCOM Mall account\)**

- **Best approach:** Let them use the same account to attend, buy and book\. Send targeted invitation emails and one\-click links to their saved interests\.

**New Consumers**

- **Best approach:** Allow guest checkout but strongly encourage account creation \(offer small promo for signing up\)\. Provide very simple account creation \(email \+ password\) and social sign\-in\.

## 6\) Payments, Fees &amp; Payout Flow \(simple explanation\)

- **Checkout:** Consumer pays at checkout using the platform payment gateway\.
- **Platform fee &#x2F; commission:** Platform collects its fee or percentage\. This can be set per package or per sale\.
- **Payout to seller:** After sale is confirmed \(or after delivery&#x2F;booking complete\), the seller gets paid by the platform \(automatic transfer to their linked bank or payment account\)\.
- **Tip:** For protection, hold funds for a short period \(e\.g\., until buyer confirms delivery\) or use instant payouts for trusted&#x2F;verified sellers\.

## 7\) Live Sessions, Webinars &amp; Demos

- Exhibitors schedule live sessions inside their booth\.
- We either embed a live stream player \(YouTube Live, Vimeo, or webinar tool\) or integrate a webinar link \(Zoom&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;Agora\)\.
- Send automatic reminder emails to users who registered for the demo\.
- Provide a Q&amp;A&#x2F;chat panel and option to collect leads from attendees\.

## 8\) Marketing &amp; Promotion \(what to do to attract visitors\)

- Publish the event landing page and the event schedule\.
- Send email blasts to the MCOM Mall mailing list\.
- Use social media posts and paid ads with the exhibition hashtag\.
- Create a press release or partner with local business groups\.
- Provide exhibitors with a marketing pack \(templates for posts, example tweets, images sized for Instagram&#x2F;Facebook\)\.
- Run limited\-time promo codes to measure uplift\.

## 9\) Moderation, Rules &amp; Risk Management

- Create a short exhibitor policy \(what is allowed and what is not\)\.
- Have an exhibitor approval flow — admin reviews before publish\.
- Provide a quick takedown process for suspicious content\.
- Keep KYC for sellers if they will receive payouts\.
- Keep a refund &amp; dispute process \(simple: buyer files dispute → exhibitor responds → admin mediates\)\.

## 10\) After the Event — follow\-up

- Export exhibitor leads and send them to each exhibitor\.
- Provide a short report to each exhibitor: views, chats, sales, bookings, conversion rate\.
- Send attendee satisfaction surveys\.
- Publish a highlight reel or summary report \(top\-selling products, best booths\)\.
- Use collected emails for retargeting the next seasonal event\.

## 11\) Simple timeline &amp; checklist \(recommended\)

**8\+ weeks before event**

- Decide dates, open exhibitor registration, create landing page, set packages\.

**4 weeks before event**

- Close late registrations, approve booths, announce schedule, start email reminders\.

**1 week before event**

- Final test of payment, live streaming, and chat\. Send final reminders to all exhibitors\.

**Day of event**

- Monitor servers and chat, assist exhibitors, run live content, answer support tickets\.

**1–2 weeks after event**

- Run final reports, pay exhibitors, and collect feedback\.

## 12\) Extra helpful checklists \(copy these for your operations\)
